Union Find implementation from https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/lecture/fjxHC/dynamic-connectivity

UnionFind

`union(p,q)` => connects points p, q

`connected(p,q)` => determines if point p, q are connected

`find(p,q)` => TBD

`count(p,q)` => determines how many connected sets exist (connected components)
